# Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Survey

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of machine learning applications in healthcare. We analyze various algorithms including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and traditional supervised learning methods applied to medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient outcome prediction.

## Introduction
Machine learning has revolutionized healthcare by enabling more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and efficient drug discovery processes. This survey examines the current state of AI in medical applications.

## Methodology
We conducted a systematic review of 200+ papers published between 2020-2024 focusing on:
- Neural networks for medical imaging
- Natural language processing for clinical notes
- Predictive modeling for patient outcomes
- Computer vision for diagnostic imaging

## Key Findings
1. Deep learning shows 95% accuracy in medical image classification
2. Transformer models excel at clinical text analysis
3. Federated learning preserves patient privacy while enabling collaborative research
4. Reinforcement learning optimizes treatment protocols

## Applications
- Radiology: Automated detection of tumors and anomalies
- Cardiology: ECG analysis and arrhythmia detection
- Oncology: Cancer staging and treatment recommendation
- Pharmaceuticals: Drug-target interaction prediction

## Conclusion
Machine learning continues to transform healthcare delivery, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy while reducing costs.
