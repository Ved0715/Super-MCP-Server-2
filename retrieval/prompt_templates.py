# Common instruction to remove confidence scores from all responses

CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Never mention confidence scores, relevance percentages, or quality indicators in your response
- When citing sources, use clean format: [Source 1 - Book Name] instead of [Source 1 - Book Name (Confidence: X.XX)]
- Ignore any confidence scores like (Confidence: 0.85), relevance scores, or quality ratings in the provided context
- Focus only on the content and knowledge, not on confidence metrics or reliability scores
- Remove any numerical confidence indicators from your citations and references

CITATION AND REFERENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Include page references when available (e.g., "See Page 45-67" or "Reference: Chapter 3, Page 120")
- Add specific book citations with chapter/section information when possible
- Reference specific topics or concepts with their source locations
- Use format: "According to [Book Name, Chapter X, Page Y]: content..."
- When discussing multiple concepts, cite the specific source for each"""
